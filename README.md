# colour-tool
It's a really rough and basic tool from a newbie programmer using colour-science/colour mostly just for things I want to use it for or think of adding to it.

You need `colour-science` and `tabulate`, which can be acquired from `pip`.

Example output, generating a palette:
```
Choose from the options available:
        1. Generate Palette
        2. Get from Jch
